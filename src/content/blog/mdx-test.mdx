# React Class Component Test

Testing a React class component to avoid hooks-related issues:

import ClassBasedReactTest from "../../react-components/ClassBasedReactTest"

<ClassBasedReactTest client:only="react" />

## Features Tested

This component demonstrates several React features:

1. <strong>Class component state</strong> - Managing state without hooks
2. <strong>Event Handlers</strong> - Button click handlers
3. <strong>Conditional Rendering</strong> - The message that appears after 5+ clicks
4. <strong>Dynamic Styling</strong> - Theme toggling

If all these features work correctly, it confirms that MDX is integrated with React!
