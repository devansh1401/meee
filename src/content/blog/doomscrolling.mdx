so, i've been stewing on this idea for what feels like forever. i've got this itch to rant about how doomscrolling and those addictive reels/shorts are slowly turning our brains to mush—but i keep putting it off. but i _will_ finish it. soon. (hopefully. fingers crossed.)

ever notice how you're caught in this loop? one minute you're checking a clip, and the next you're hooked, unable to break free from the dopamine hit. it's wild how the algorithms are engineered to keep you glued to your screen. we might not fully grasp the damage, but trust me, it’s real.

_this is just the rough sketch of a messy little draft. until i polish it up, here’s a fun list of 50 things to do instead of wasting your life on your phone:_

## 50 things to do instead of staring at your phone

1. read a book (yes, an actual book)
2. write in a journal (or just scribble nonsense)
3. learn a new skill (like whistling really loud idk)
4. meditate (or just sit in silence for once)
5. google something random and go down a rabbit hole
6. try to remember all the capitals of the world (bet you can’t)
7. make a vision board or some goals or whatever
8. take an online course (or pretend to)
9. start a creative project you’ll probably abandon
10. plan your week (or just make a fake aesthetic planner)
11. go touch grass (literally)
12. do a workout (or at least one pushup)
13. dance like no one's watching (or like they _are_)
14. wash the dishes (be a responsible human for once)
15. clean your room (trust me, future you will be grateful)
16. stretch (your body is _not_ supposed to crack like that)
17. play a sport (or throw a ball at a wall)
18. call someone instead of texting (crazy, right?)
19. write a letter to your future self (or just roast your past self)
20. volunteer for something (helping people is cool)
21. go outside and stare at the sky (deep thoughts will follow)
22. cook something (or at least make instant noodles)
23. organize a game night (and be _that_ competitive friend)
24. plan an event (even if it’s just a solo pizza night)
25. compliment a stranger (wholesome af)
26. pick up an instrument (even if you suck at it)
27. visit a neighbor (but don’t be weird about it)
28. play frisbee or something (or just throw stuff)
29. sit on a rooftop and think about life
30. do a puzzle (test that brainpower)
31. try making music (or just make beats by tapping on things)
32. take a nap (but not the 6-hour accidental kind)
33. make a cartoon flipbook (stick figures count)
34. build a fort out of bedsheets (throwback to childhood)
35. listen to a podcast (but not one that rots your brain more)
36. learn morse code (why not?)
37. start learning a new language (or just pretend to)
38. attempt a handstand (just don’t break anything)
39. go actually hang out with people in person
40. try playing piano upside down (idk sounds fun)
41. do your damn laundry (you know you need to)
42. watch the sunset (without filming it for once)
43. build a snowman (if you have snow, obviously)
44. visit a museum and pretend to understand art
45. go on a hike (or just walk somewhere new)
46. admire nature (yes, that includes pigeons)
47. climb a tree (channel your inner monkey)
48. just stare into space and daydream
49. journal about your weirdest dreams
50. doodle something stupid
